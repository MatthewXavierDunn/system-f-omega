# Simply Typed Lambda Calculus

An interpretor for an extension of the simply typed lambda calculus, more
formally a variation of System F $\omega$ from the lambda cube; that is to say
that there exists type polymorphism and types that depend on other types
(different from dependent typiing) within the calculus.

However, the language itself does not follow the absolute strict definition of
System F $\omega$, only borrowing some of the redexes and type inference rules.
